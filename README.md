# Dragster-Disassembly
Disassembly of Dragster (Atari 2600) generated by Distella

# Compiling
At the moment, I've only been able to get 8bitworkshop to make use of the disassembled code. It is available here:
https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.3.0/?platform=vcs
It's also a good resource for learning Atari 2600 emulation.
